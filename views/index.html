        A Coffee Chats bot for Zulip
      </h1>
    </header>

    <main>
      <p class="bold">Oh hi,</p>
      
      <p>This is the backend for a bot allowing current participants of the Recurse Center to get matched for coffee with each other.</p>
      
      <p>To get matched, subscribe yourself to the <a href="https://recurse.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/142655-Coffee-Chats">Coffee Chats Zulip channel</a> before 10am on any given day. We'll find you someone to meet up with!</p>
      <p>Coffee isn't required - it could be tea, or snacks, or just a walk - and you don't even have to leave the building if you just want to catch up in the kitchen or somewhere else on the 4th floor.</p>
      <p>If you're sick that day and forget to remove yourself, don't worry! You can just meet with the person you paired with once you're back. </p>
      <p>Feel free to add or remove yourself at any point, (just try to do so before 10am if you don't want to have coffee that day). Thanks and happy chatting!</p>
